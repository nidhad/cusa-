# [cusa] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [cutlet]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [nidhad] - [College of engineering thalassery]


### Project Description
CuSA is an  web app that judges your cutlets like a Michelin-star chef üßë‚Äçüç≥. It scans your cutlet's shape,  and symmetry, then roasts or praises it with hilarious feedback.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody needs to measure cutlet perfection‚Ä¶ until they realize their cousin‚Äôs cutlets are suspiciously rounder than theirs. #CutletEnvy

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
CuSA uses computer vision to:
Score symmetry (0-10)
Roast uneven edges like Gordon Ramsay üî•

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
Software:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Because the web deserves cutlet justice)

Canvas API (To draw shame circles around bad cutlets)

OpenCV.js (For "serious" shape analysis)

For Hardware:
-üç≥ 1 frying pan (preferably non-stick)

üëÅÔ∏è 1 smartphone camera (to capture cutlet crime
